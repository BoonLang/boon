# Milestone 2: Language Server

**Status**: Not Started

## Overview

Add a language server to the Boon playground that provides inline type annotations and rich error messages. The LSP runs in a WebWorker, written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Type annotations appear inline in CodeMirror editor
- [ ] Type checker catches type errors with clear ariadne-style messages
- [ ] LSP runs in WebWorker (non-blocking)
- [ ] Hover shows inferred types for any expression
- [ ] Real-time feedback as user types

---

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: M1 (New Engine) - type system needs working evaluator
- **Enables**: Better developer experience, catches bugs early

---

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Inline types | Types displayed after variable names in editor |
| Type errors | Red squiggles and error panel with suggestions |
| WebWorker LSP | Non-blocking analysis in background thread |
| Hover info | Show type on mouse hover |
| Go to definition | Jump to variable/function definitions |

---

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for type inference engine
- Integration tests with sample Boon programs
- Visual tests comparing expected vs actual inline types
- Error message quality tests (clear, actionable)
