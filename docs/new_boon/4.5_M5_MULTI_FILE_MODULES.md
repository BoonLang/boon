# Milestone 5: Multi-File Modules

**Status**: Not Started

## Overview

Enable the playground to run multi-file Boon projects like todo_mvc_physical. This requires a virtual filesystem in the browser, module imports, BUILD.bn for code generation, and RUN.bn as the entry point. Also integrates RayBox for 3D physically-based UI rendering.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] todo_mvc_physical example runs in playground
- [ ] Virtual filesystem supports multiple .bn files
- [ ] BUILD.bn generates code (e.g., Assets.bn from SVGs)
- [ ] RUN.bn serves as project entry point
- [ ] Module imports work across files (Theme/, Generated/)
- [ ] RayBox renders 3D physically-based UI

---

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: M1 (New Engine), RayBox finished (`~/repos/RayBox`)
- **Enables**: M8 (kavik.cz)

---

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Virtual FS | In-memory filesystem in browser |
| Module system | Import code across .bn files |
| BUILD.bn | Code generation phase |
| RUN.bn | Application entry point |
| RayBox | 3D physically-based rendering |

## Testing Strategy

- Virtual filesystem unit tests
- Module resolution tests
- BUILD.bn execution tests
- Full todo_mvc_physical integration test
- Visual comparison with RayBox rendering
