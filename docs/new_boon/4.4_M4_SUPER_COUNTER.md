# Milestone 4: Super-Counter

**Status**: Not Started

## Overview

Build the complete super-counter demonstration: a physical button on an iCESugar FPGA board triggers a counter update on a Raspberry Pi backend, which notifies all connected clients (web app, CLI, and the FPGA LED) via reactive dataflow. Includes basic boon-console to visualize events flowing across all platforms.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Physical button on iCESugar board works
- [ ] Raspberry Pi backend receives button press
- [ ] Database stores counter value persistently
- [ ] Web app displays and updates counter
- [ ] CLI tool shows counter and runs commands
- [ ] FPGA LED responds to counter state
- [ ] All clients stay synchronized in real-time
- [ ] Basic boon-console shows events across all clients

---

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: M0 (Boon CLI) - for server runtime and CLI client
- **Requires**: M3 (FPGA Transpiler) - for FPGA button/LED
- **Enables**: Proof that Boon works across hardware + software, M10 (full boon-console)

## Basic boon-console (M4 Scope)

The super-counter needs visibility into what's happening across all platforms. Basic boon-console provides:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Event log | Text stream of events from all clients |
| Connection status | Which clients are connected |
| Message flow | See button press → server → all clients |
| Simple UI | Terminal-based or basic web panel |

**Not in M4 scope** (deferred to M10):
- 3D graph visualization
- Time-travel debugging
- State inspection
- Breakpoints

---

## Debug Protocol (Foundation for M10)

Each client exposes a debug endpoint:

```json
// Event: Button pressed on FPGA
{"type": "event", "source": "fpga", "name": "button_press", "time": 1234567890}

// Event: Server received
{"type": "event", "source": "server", "name": "increment", "count": 42}

// Event: Client updated
{"type": "event", "source": "web", "name": "state_update", "count": 42}
```

This protocol becomes the foundation for M10's full boon-console.

---

## Testing Strategy

- Hardware-in-the-loop tests with actual FPGA
- Network latency and reliability tests
- Database persistence tests
- Multi-client synchronization tests
- boon-console event verification (all events visible)

## Related Documentation

- README.md - super-counter project vision
- §3.3 Cross-Platform - platform abstraction
- §6.8 Protocols - UART, WebSocket, and debug protocol specs
- M0 - Provides CLI runtime foundation
- M10 - Full boon-console builds on this foundation

## boon serve (Implemented in M4)

`boon serve` is implemented as part of M4, not M0. It requires:
- WebSocket infrastructure for client sync
- Database integration for persistence
- HTTP API for web app

M0 provides the CLI foundation (`boon run`, `boon eval`, `boon test`) which M4 builds upon.
