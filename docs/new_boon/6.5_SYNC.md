### 🔴 REMAINING (Low Priority for M0/M1)

| File | Task | Priority |
|------|------|----------|
| 1.1_GETTING_STARTED.md | Add TextTemplate node to table | Low |
| 1.1_GETTING_STARTED.md | Add sections: Alias field-paths (14), Effect nodes (18) | Low |
| 3.1_MODULES.md | Add CLI/server-only note to run_until_quiescent | Low (Polish) |

**Recently completed (Round 5):**
- JSON schema for Document/new with scalar vs element root handling
- TaggedObject in plan Payload enum and materialize() function
- Hardware wording clarified (design enables HDL transpiler, not direct synthesis)
- tick_scheduled clarified for both browser and CLI purposes
- GraphSnapshot purpose/use cases (persistence scope for M0/M1)
- Style converters handle TaggedObject (Oklch, Duration)
- Element/* portability (universal data, platform-specific rendering)
- api/ tree marked as future refactor (M0/M1 uses evaluator_v2/api.rs)
- Tagged object format consistency (_type: "tagged_object")

**Previously completed (Round 4):**
- Sort key consistency: (source_id, scope_id, port) across 2.4, 2.0, 6.1
- RAF/microtask alignment across 6.1 and 4.9
- GraphSnapshot timer fields and SlotId serialization
- Unit/Nothing/Bool consistency across 2.9, 2.3, 6.8
- TaggedObject runtime representation defined
- Element event payloads table added to 2.8

### Notes

- Engine location is canonical at `crates/boon/src/engine_v2/` (platform-agnostic)
- API functions live in `evaluator_v2/api.rs` (single file, not api_v2/ directory)
- Timer/interval uses Duration pipe pattern: `Duration[seconds: 1] |> Timer/interval()`
- Stream/pulses and Stream/skip are in Stream namespace, not Timer
- Payload::Unit replaces informal Payload::Empty for signal events
- Payload::TaggedObject for Duration, Oklch, Hidden, etc.
- Two JSON modes: Protocol (type-wrapped) vs Materialized (plain values)
- FLUSH semantics: Type system uses unions, runtime uses Payload::Flushed wrapper
- Bool: conceptually tags (True/False), runtime uses Payload::Bool(bool) for efficiency
- Unit: Boon literal is [], runtime is Payload::Unit, JSON is null
- Nothing: not a Payload variant - "no value" is node not emitting
- Browser scheduling: queueMicrotask for propagation, setTimeout for timers
- Document/new is universal (CLI outputs JSON, browser renders DOM)
