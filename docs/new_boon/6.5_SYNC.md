### Notes

- Engine location is canonical at `crates/boon/src/engine_v2/` (platform-agnostic)
- Timer/interval uses Duration pipe pattern: `Duration[seconds: 1] |> Timer/interval()`
- Stream/pulses and Stream/skip are in Stream namespace, not Timer
- Payload::Unit replaces informal Payload::Empty for signal events
- Two JSON modes: Protocol (type-wrapped) vs Materialized (plain values)
- FLUSH semantics: Type system uses unions, runtime uses Payload::Flushed wrapper
- BUILD.bn: CLI uses blocking run_until_quiescent, browser uses async microtask pump
