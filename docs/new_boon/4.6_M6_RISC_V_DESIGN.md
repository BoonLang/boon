# Milestone 6: RISC-V Design

**Status**: Not Started

## Overview

Implement a complete RV32I RISC-V processor in Boon. The design should pass RISC-V compliance tests and synthesize to FPGA via the M3 transpiler.

**Note:** This milestone will discover and document the "synthesizable subset" of Boon - which constructs can become hardware. Rather than pre-defining this subset, we learn by doing during RISC-V implementation.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] RV32I processor implemented in Boon
- [ ] 5-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB)
- [ ] Hazard detection and data forwarding
- [ ] Passes RISC-V compliance test suite
- [ ] Synthesizes to iCESugar FPGA
- [ ] Runs simple assembly programs
- [ ] Synthesizable subset documented (discovered during implementation)

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: M3 (FPGA Transpiler) - to synthesize to FPGA
- **Enables**: M7 (RISC-V Runtime)
