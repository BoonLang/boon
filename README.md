Boon is:
- Declarative, statically-typed, based on Rust streams. 
- The runtime remembers its values, enabling website hot-reloading and state persistence (replacing databases) as built-in features.
- No locks in the runtime, allowing even easy multi-threaded web frontend development.
- [Persons.pro](https://persons.pro/) will be the first web app written in Boon.
- The playground is written using the Rust MoonZoon framework and integrates CodeMirror editor.
- Use cases: Everywhere Rust may not be well-suited.

The goal is to answer these questions:
- _"How simple can a useful language be?"_
- _"Can databases, file storage, threads, and protocols be used transparently?"_
- _"Can we kill an app and then later resume it?"_
- _"Can an app be monitored or partly developed like in factory automation games?"_
