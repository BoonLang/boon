Implement properly everything in
  @docs/new_boon/plans/M0_M1_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md. Check a finished item from the
  checklist only when honestly and properly verified. Don't stop until all compltely done and
  all verified. When honestly everything completed and verified, especially counter.bn and
  todo_mvc.bn fully work in browser tested by your mcp (adding todos, filterring todos, removing
  todos) - when it works say <promise>M0 AND M1 DONE</promise>. Also never run cargo build or cargo check on fronted Rust crate - alwys read background job with mzoon - id does notwork and together with bsh sleep if freezes you forever
