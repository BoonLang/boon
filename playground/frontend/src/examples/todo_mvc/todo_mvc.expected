# TodoMVC example - comprehensive CRUD test
#
# NOTE: This example starts with 2 pre-populated todos:
#   - "Buy groceries"
#   - "Clean room"
#
# Test Flow:
# 1. Input ready checks (BUG #1: auto-focus on start)
# 2. FILTER TESTS (with initial todos only)
#    + BUG #2: Input should NOT re-focus after filter click
# 3. Add multiple todos
# 4. Toggle dynamic todo (BUG #3: checkbox isolation test)
# 5. Toggle complete (check/uncheck)
# 6. Toggle all
# 7. Check different todo
# 8. Edit todo (double-click)
# 9. Escape cancel edit
# 10. Delete todo
# 11. Clear completed (BUG #4: must remove correct todos)
# 12. Persistence checks
#
# ==========================================
# KNOWN ENGINE BUG: List/retain reactive filter for dynamic items
# ==========================================
# When todos are added dynamically via List/append, the filter condition
# (PASSED.store.selected_filter |> WHILE {...}) doesn't properly subscribe
# to selected_filter changes. The filter evaluates once but doesn't update
# when the user clicks Active/Completed/All filters.
#
# This is a bug in engine_v2/event_loop.rs clone_transform_subgraph_runtime()
# where cloned SwitchedWire nodes don't receive updates from external deps.
#
# WORKAROUND: Test filters with initial todos only (before adding dynamic).
# ==========================================
