I've created new folder for you - digitaljs_boon in
@playground/frontend/src/examples/hw_examples/super_counter/ - create all artifacts for this session
there (repos, plans, code, .. everything).\
You have a big task in front of you - I would like to run digitaljs locally. It uses by default ports
3000 and 8080, use 3001 and 8081 becasue the original ports are already used and i dont want to kill
what it running there. Then
@playground/frontend/src/examples/hw_examples/super_counter/super_counter.sv should be opened there by
default and you should be able to synthetize it and run somulation by clicking Run button just after
starting the application. You'll probaly need to clone GitHub repos digitaljs, digitaljs_online and
yosys2digitaljs to make it work. Watch our for broken styles becasue when you want to run their dev
server before, all circuit cells appeared black becasue of missing styles and textinput in cells were
broken and you weren't able to fix it all all later - do as less changes as possible to no break them
again. Then, when you can Run the super_counter.sv, we'll start to extends I/O tab in the app. There
should be textare looking like terminal and we should be able to talk with the simulated FPGA through
the terminal that will be simulating UART interface. Look at ~/repos/super_counter_rust to know how the
 interface work. This will be very DIFFICULT TASK so you need to ultrathing it properly. You'll need to
 somehow control browser - probably Chrome. I don't care what way you choose - browsermcp or direct
communication throuhg one of Chrome debug protocols or to create extension like Google Antigravity
uses.. does not matter for me how long it will take and if I'll need to support you in case you'll be
able to relible control the browser for proper implemenation and testing/verificton of your work. Also
the terminal should remember history (both input and output). Terminal will be dispaly when singals
`uart_tx` and `uart_rx` are in the code (or suggest better condition/connection). You can download
latest dependneices, latest Yosys, Yosys Wasm or whatever will make the code cleaner and realiabe and
correct. You can create as many docs as you want in the digitaljs_boon folder if you think it will help
 you to prepare plan and implement it properly. Any questions?
