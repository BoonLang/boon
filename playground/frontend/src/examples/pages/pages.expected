# Pages example - multi-page router navigation
#
# Test Flow:
# 1. Initial state check (Home page)
# 2. Click About → verify page content AND URL changes
# 3. Click Contact → verify page content AND URL changes
# 4. Click Home → verify back to home page AND URL changes
#
# NOTE: This test verifies URL path changes, which is essential for
# proper router behavior (back/forward buttons, bookmarking, sharing links)

[output]
# Initial page should be Home
