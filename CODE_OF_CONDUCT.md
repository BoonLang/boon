# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to a welcoming, respectful, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully  
- Focusing on what’s best for the community  
- Showing empathy toward other community members  

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassing language or imagery, sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting or demeaning comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others’ private information (physical or electronic addresses) without permission  
- Other behavior which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem outside this code.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions, comments, code, issues, and other interactions that violate this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, etc.) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project (for example, via an official project e-mail address, on social media, or as an appointed representative).

## Reporting & Enforcement

If you encounter a behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by emailing **martin@kavik.cz**. All reports will be handled with discretion and evaluated by the maintainers.

In responses, maintainers may issue warnings, temporary bans, or permanent bans, depending on the severity of the violation.
